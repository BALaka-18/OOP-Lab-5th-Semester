## DAY 1 PROBLEMS AND THEIR SOLUTIONS :

Q1. Write a program that prints the quadrant number of a point (x,y) on a plane. Recall that points in quadrant 1 have positive x and y values, points in quadrant 2 have a negative x value and a positive y value, points in quadrant 3 have negative x and y values, and the remaining points are in the quadrant 4. If a point is on an axis, choose the quadrant with the lower quadrant number.

Q3. The salary scheme for a company is given as follows:
Salary range for grade A: $700 - $899
Salary range for grade B: $600 - $799
Salary range for grade C: $500 - $649
 
A person whose salary is between $600 and $649 is in grade C if his merit points are below 10, otherwise he is in grade B. A person whose salary is between $700 and $799 is in grade B if his merit points are below 20, otherwise, he is in grade A. Write a program to read in a person’s salary and his merit points, and displays his grade.
